# INFO 443 Project 2 - Nodejs

Collaborators: Leah Jia, Hamda Hassan, Yuhang Liu, Efra Ahsan

# Content and Background
**Forked repo: https://github.com/efra-tech/node**   

Node.js is a popular open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on various platforms such as Windows, MacOSX, Linux, and more–and it’s free. It essentially enables developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, rather than through just the web browser. Node can communicate with the computer’s server and file system in a memory-efficient, asynchronous, and single-threaded manner, which was more difficult and slow before its invention. It’s commonly used by developers to create a database within a computer’s server, and modify or use the data in a streamlined way, which therefore helps make webpage content more dynamic and pertaining to the real-time data. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that is well-suited for building real-time and scalable network applications. Node.js is a powerful development tool for building backended web applications and has gained widespread adoption among developers.  

Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl, a software engineer, in 2009. He released the first version of Node.js in 2010, which initially supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Also in 2010, the Node.js environment adopted its package manager, npm, which is still in place today. The package manager streamlines the software installations and updates, as well as facilitates the ability to share and publish source code. By 2015, Node.js was governed by the Node.js Foundation, which is a collaborative project of the Linux Foundation. It has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).   

The Node.js project has a technical steering committee (TSC) that is responsible for approving high-level changes to the codebase and architecture. The TSC is made up of a group of individuals who have made significant contributions to the project and who are elected by the community. They are responsible for voting to set the technical direction of the project and reviewing and approving changes to the codebase. In addition to the TSC, there is also a core team of maintainers who are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests, managing issues, and ensuring the overall health of the project.
